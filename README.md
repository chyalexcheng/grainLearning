Bayesian uncertainty quantification for discrete and continuum numerical models of granular materials,
developed by various projects of the University of Twente (NL), the Netherlands eScience Center (NL), University of
Newcastle (AU), and Hiroshima University (JP).
Browse to the [GrainLearning documentation](https://grainlearning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get started.

## Features

- Infer and update model parameters using "time" series (sequence) data
  via [Sequential Monte Carlo filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_Filter)
- Uniform, quasi-random sampling using [low-discrepancy sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halton_sequence)
- Iterative sampling by training a
  nonparametric [Gaussian mixture model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.mixture.BayesianGaussianMixture.html)
- [Surrogate modeling](https://grainlearning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rnn.html) capability for "time" series data

[//]: # (- Hybrid physics-based and data-driven model evaluation strategy)

## Installation

### Install using poetry

1. Install poetry following [these instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GrainLearning/grainLearning.git`
1. Go to the source code directory: `cd grainLearning`
1. Activate the virtual environment: `poetry shell`
1. Install GrainLearning and its dependencies: `poetry install`

### Install using pip

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GrainLearning/grainLearning.git`
1. Go to the source code directory: `cd grainLearning`
1. Activate the virtual environment: `conda create --name grainlearning python=3.8 && conda activate grainlearning`
1. Install GrainLearning and its dependencies: `pip install .`

__Developers__ please refer to [README.dev.md](README.dev.md).

To install GrainLearning including the RNN module capabilities check [grainlearning/rnn/README.md](grainlearning/rnn/README.md).

### For Windows users

- Installation using Windows Subsystem for Linx (WSL)
  - Enable WSL1 or WSL2 according to the
    instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual)
  - Install GrainLearning using [poetry](#install-using-poetry) or [pip](#install-using-pip)
- Installation using anaconda (if no WSLs are available on your Windows system)
  - Open Anaconda Prompt and install GrainLearning using [pip](#install-using-pip). This should create a virtual
    environment, named GrainLearning.
  - Choose that environment from your anaconda navigator: click `Environments` and select `grainlearning` from the
    drop-down menu

### One command installation

Stable versions of GrainLearning can be installed via `pip install grainlearning`
However, you still need to clone the GrainLearning repository to run the tutorials.

## Tutorials

1. Linear regression with
   the [`run_sim`](https://github.com/GrainLearning/grainLearning/blob/main/tutorials/simple_regression/linear_regression/python_linear_regression_solve.py#L14)
   callback function of the [`DynamicSystem`](https://github.com/GrainLearning/grainLearning/blob/main/grainlearning/dynamic_systems.py)
   class,
   in [python_linear_regression_solve.py](https://github.com/GrainLearning/grainLearning/blob/main/tutorials/simple_regression/linear_regression/python_linear_regression_solve.py)

2. Nonlinear, multivariate regression

3. Interact with the numerical model of your choice
   via [`run_sim`](https://github.com/GrainLearning/grainLearning/blob/main/tutorials/simple_regression/linear_regression/linear_regression_solve.py#L11)
   ,
   in [linear_regression_solve.py](https://github.com/GrainLearning/grainLearning/blob/main/tutorials/simple_regression/linear_regression/linear_regression_solve.py)

4. Load existing simulation data and run GrainLearning for one iteration,
   in [oedo_load_and_resample.py](https://github.com/GrainLearning/grainLearning/blob/main/tutorials/oedo_compression/oedo_load_and_resample.py)
5. RNN module tutorials:
    - [Train your RNN](tutorials/rnn/train_rnn.ipynb)
    - [Predict using an RNN](tutorials/rnn/predict.ipynb)
    - [Use an RNN in the calibration workflow](tutorials/rnn/rnn_calibration_GL.ipynb)
